# Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy. Produce a scatterplot of true vs. predicted values with a LOESS fit and a bar plot of the most important features. Generate a table showing the targeting accuracy, precision, and recall of the predictions for nine hypothetical targeting scenarios (targeting between 10% and 90% of the population).
